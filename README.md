# Flashcard Quiz App

## What Is the Purpose of the App?
The Flashcard Quiz App is designed to help people test their knowledge in a fun and simple way. It's an educational tool that works like using real flashcards — you see a question, answer it, and find out if you're right.

The goal is to make learning quick, stress-free, motivating, and fun, especially for beginners, children, or anyone who enjoys quiz-style learning.

## How Does the App Work?

### 1. Welcome Screen
* When the app opens, you first see a clean and friendly screen.
* There's a large "Start" button — this is the beginning of the quiz.
* The screen is easy to understand, even for someone using the app for the first time.

### 2. Quiz Section
* After tapping "Start", the user enters the quiz.
* Questions are shown one at a time.
* The user selects their answer (like True or False).
* Feedback will pop up telling the user if's answer is correct or incorrect.
* This keeps the flow simple— no distractions or complex steps.

### 3. Score Screen
* After answering all questions, the app shows the user's final score (e.g., “You got 4 out of 5”).
* It also gives a feedback message:
    * If the score is 3 or more → “Great job!”
    * If the score is lower → “Keep practicing!”
* This feedback helps keep users encouraged and motivated to try again.

### 4. Extra Options
* The score screen has two buttons:
    * "Review" – to go back and look over the questions and answers.
    * "Exit" – to close the app completely.

The Flashcard Quiz App is a great example of a small but useful learning tool. It teaches people in a simple and motivating way. It’s great for all ages and can easily be expanded with more features in the future. It’s not just a quiz — it’s a smart way to learn, remember, and have fun while doing it.
